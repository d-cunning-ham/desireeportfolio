                    <p>Representation matters in all facets of life.
                        So what does it mean for Black tech professionals who represent only 8% of the tech industry?<br>
                        For some Black and African American tech workers, underrepresentation and feeling like ‚Äúthe other‚Äù is isolating and demoralizing.
                        For others, like Skillcrush alum and Software Engineer Nicole Young, this statistic was a call to action to educate Black folks
                        and create a community of tech professionals who can feel comfortable and seen.<br>
                        Learn why Black people, especially Black women, are underrepresented in tech, and let us introduce you to the Black-owned and/or
                        led organizations and initiatives that have stepped up to change the ratio.</p>

                    <p>A LOT can happen in 10 years!<br>
                        Skillcrush was founded in 2012 with the mission to ‚Äúimprove women‚Äôs quality of life through digital empowerment
                        and skills to enter high-earning and flexible careers.‚Äù<br>

                        We embody this principle with our comprehensive tech curricula and career counseling that changes the lives of our countless students.<br>

                    <p>Let‚Äôs stop saying we all have the same 24 hours.<br>
                        While good-willed, several factors limit the number of expendable hours that one may have to complete a coding school.<br>
                        Consider that full-time professionals work an average of 38.7 hours a week.
                        Even more, Americans spend 42 hours on average performing household tasks per month, with women spending 49 hours on tasks
                         ‚Äî 13 hours more than men. And parents? They spend approximately 51 hours on house duties per month ‚Äî 13 hours more than nonparents!<br>
                        This all goes to say, the hours left after work, home, and caretaking duties are limited, making completing a coding bootcamp daunting.<br>
                        We get it! And we‚Äôre here to say that you can do this with support from the Skillcrush community. Read our practical guide to completing
                         a coding school while working full time in 2023.</p>
