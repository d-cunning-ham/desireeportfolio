                <p>Some would say this is where you put the elevator pitch. If you're looking for that, feel free to peruse my resume.
                But for the next few lines of text, I want to tell you what makes me the best candidate.</p><br>
                
                <p>I started my career at an agency, Markitors</a>, supporting the growth of small businesses.
                Forged through fire, I juggled various niche clients, from healthcare and recruiting to hospitality and lifestyle.</p><br>
                
                <p>If you know what they say about agency life, you'll know it's not for the faint of heart. <b>Daily communication with international clients.
                Managing complex PPC budgets. Crafting multiplex segmented email campaigns. Writing articles, white papers, and ebooks. Tracking KPIs</b>.</p><br>
                
                <p>I did it all. And it made me a better version of myself. I can work in <b>fast-paced environments, juggling competing priorities
                and navigating delicate client and team relationships.</b></p><br>

                <p>I didn't stay a marketer for long. Soon after, I became a content marketing manager and then a senior content marketing manager and editor.</p><br>

                <p>I pride myself in my <b>written and spoken communication</b>. I earned my Master of Arts in English to improve my communication, leadership, and critical thinking skills. The better I can communicate with my team, the more efficient we are.
                Likewise, the better I communicate with stakeholders, the better the product and the likelihood of converting target customers.</p><br>

                <p>I'd be remiss to say I just <b>edited for grammar, spelling, readability, AP style, and SEO</b>, though.
                    <b>My greatest accomplishment is leading and mentoring a team of brilliant writers and freelancers.</b></p><br>

                <p>In addition to being the senior content marketing manager and editor, I was my content team's <b>Agile scrum master</b>.
                I was the team liaison, <b>project manager</b>, and cheerleader in this role. We won together, or we lost together.
                But between you and me: <i> I like to win and will do everything possible to support the team across the finish line!</i></p><br>

                <p>This brings me to my most recent experience as a senior content marketing manager. The apex of my career thus far.
                If this were a Harry Potter movie, this is the silence right before Harry tumbles from Hagrid's arms on the Hogwarts battlefield.</p><br>
                
                <p>All the skills acquired up until this point prepared me to:</p><br>
                <ul><b>
                    <li>Write dynamic strategies</li>
                    <li>Monitor KPIs</li>
                    <li>Write engaging content for a diverse audience</li>
                    <li>Maintain strict deadlines</li> 
                    <li>Manage contributors</li>
                </b></ul>

                <p>Lastly, here are two things you need to know about me:</p></br>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>I'm resilient.</b> Let's address the elephant in the room. My tenures at BestColleges and SKillcrush are quite short.
                    Unfortunately, I was laid off twice in the last nine months. I don't take this lightly, and I know employers don't either.
                    But I can assure you that I want to stay long-term at a company and contribute. While devastating, I've grown which leads me to my next point.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>I'm a lifelong learner.</b> I believe in the power of education. As a first-generation college graduate, I know my knowledge is my power.
                    This thesis is why I earned my Master's degree in English. It's also why I learned how to code. <i>You didn't think this was a WordPress theme, did you?
                    I taught myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build this site.</i> The bottom line is that I can learn on the fly.
                    Where my experience may "lack," I more than make up for it in gusto, and I'm excited to prove it!</li>
                </ol>

                <br>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to read my candidacy story. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
