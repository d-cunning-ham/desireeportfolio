                <p>Some would say this is where you put the elevator pitch. If you're looking for that, feel free to peruse my resume.
                But for the next few lines of text, I want to tell you what makes me the best candidate.</p><br>
                
                <p>I started my career at an agency, Markitors</a>, supporting the growth of small businesses.
                Forged through fire, I juggled various niche clients, from healthcare and recruiting to hospitality and lifestyle.</p><br>
                
                <p>If you know what they say about agency life, you'll know it's not for the faint of heart. <b>Daily communication with international clients.
                Managing complex PPC budgets. Crafting multiplex segmented email campaigns. Writing articles, white papers, and ebooks. Tracking KPIs</b>.</p><br>
                
                <p>I did it all. And it made me a better version of myself. I can work in <b>fast-paced environments, juggling competing priorities
                and navigating delicate client and team relationships.</b></p><br>

                <p>I didn't stay a digital marketer for long. Soon after, I became a content marketing manager and then a senior content marketing manager and editor.</p><br>

                <p>I pride myself in my <b>written and spoken communication</b>. I earned my Master of Arts in English to improve my communication, leadership, and critical thinking skills. The better I can communicate with my team, the more efficient we are.
                Likewise, the better I communicate with stakeholders, the better the product and the likelihood of converting target customers.</p><br>

                <p>I'd be remiss to say I just <b>edited for grammar, spelling, readability, AP style, and SEO</b>, though.
                    <b>My greatest accomplishment is leading and mentoring a team of brilliant writers and freelancers.</b></p><br>

                <p>In addition to being the senior content marketing manager and editor, I was my content team's <b>Agile scrum master</b>.
                I was the team liaison, <b>project manager</b>, and cheerleader in this role. We won together, or we lost together.
                But between you and me: <i> I like to win and will do everything possible to support the team across the finish line!</i></p><br>

                <p>As a senior content marketing manager, I pride myself in being flexible and a lifelong learner. For me, this means continuously
                    challenging my knowledge and skills. This need for challenge brought me to Skillcrush, an online coding school.</p>

                <p>At Skillcrush, I was the Editor-in-Chief creating content for 20,000 users and generating 1,3000 marketing qualified leads
                    MoM. How'd I do this? Coming from an agency background, I was more than prepared to dive deep and create a compelling brand narrative
                    and content strategies that resonated with users and converted clients!</p>

                <p>I conducted a slew of analysis:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Comeptitive analysis</li>
                        <li>Market analysis</li>
                        <li>SEO audit</li>
                        <li>Content analysis</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>Using that knowledge, I collaborated with the Leadership, Sales, Product, Design, and Marketing teams to
                    understand Skillcrush's business initiatives as well as what's working and what's not working. In addition to
                collaborating with the team, I undertook one of my greatest projects to date: learning to code!</p>

                <p>I said I like a challenge! And I pride myself on creating compelling, interesting, and lead generative content! To
                meet the needs of my users, I placed myself in their shoes and learned how to code! This experience made
                me a more empathetic marketer, a budding front-end developer, and a more appreciative student. I am so grateful for
                this experience because it better prepared me for my next role at Jogan Inc.</p>

                <p>Currently, I am the head of content at Jogan Inc., an early-stage startup in Colorado, where I built a talented
                    content marketing team, created the brand narrative for six brand launches, and built the content marketing processes
                    for a new team</p>
            
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to read my candidacy story. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
